sTimeline application helps in creating and maintaining records of historical or fictional events.

It is especially suited for writers, but can also be used by historians, or anybody who wants to
(for example) write a family history.

Apart from events arranged in a timeline, the app allows to specify accompanying information, background
descriptions, biographies of people and objects.

sTimeline supports arbitrary time systems (you can define your own calendar and time rules).
