sTimeline application helps in creating and maintaining records of historical or
fictional events.

It is especially suited for writers, but can also be used by historians, or
anybody who wants to (for example) write a family chronicle.

Apart from events arranged in a timeline, the app allows to specify accompanying
information, background descriptions, biographies of people and objects.

sTimeline supports arbitrary time systems (you can define your own calendar and
time rules), which can be especially useful for science fiction and fantasy
authors.
