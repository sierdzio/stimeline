Short and incomplete list of what is left to be done here:

- unit tests, especially for SEvent, STimeline, SCalendar and SDateTime classes
- whole GUI, obviously
- support for file attachments
- support JSON and binary JSON load/ save
- nice GUI for timeline, with smooth zooming and swiping (EventTimeline)
- use magic macros for Q_OBJECTS
- add null datetime (when it is not set)
- object description - text elide fixes + add ability to expand the item to show
  whole text
- clean up temp dir after using it (save/ load)
- BUG: sometimes it is not possible to edit datetime (Android?)
- BUG: popups do not fit on Android
- make Android Intent use ContentProvider to share files
- prompt for storage permission
- BUG: when loading different calendar, month names and lengths are not updated
