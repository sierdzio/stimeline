Short and incomplete list of what is left to be done here:

- unit tests, especially for SEvent, STimeline, SCalendar and SDateTime classes
- whole GUI, obviously
- support for saving images/ file attachments
- support JSON and binary JSON load/ save
- nice GUI for timeline, with smooth zooming and swiping (EventTimeline)
- use magic macros for Q_OBJECTS
